Libsmb2 is a userspace client library for accessing SMB2/SMB3 shares on a
network.
It depends on both MIT Kerberos as well as GSS-NTLMSSP
[https://github.com/simo5/gss-ntlmssp] for authentication.

It is high performance and fully async. It supports both zero-copy
for SMB READ/WRITE commands as well as compounded commands.

Libsmb2 is distributed under the LGPLv2.1 licence.


API
===
Libsmb2 implements three different APIs for accessing remote SMB shares :

1, High level synchronous posix-like API.
This is a simple API for accessing a share.
The functions in this API are modelled to be be similar to the corresponding
POSIX functions.
This API is described in libsmb.h

2, High level async posix-like API.
This is a high performance, fully non-blocking and async API.
The functions in this API are modelled to be be similar to the corresponding
POSIX functions.
This is the recommended API.
This API is described in libsmb.h

3, Low level async RAW API.
This is a low level API that provides direct access to the SMB2 PDUs
and data structures.
This API is described in libsmb-raw.h


SMB URL Format
==============
The SMB URL format is currently a small subset of the URL format that is
defined/used by the Samba project.
The goal is to eventually support the full URL format, thus making URLs
interchangable between Samba utilities and Libsmb2 but we are not there yet.

smb://[<domain>;][<user>@]<server>/<share>[/path][?arg=val[&arg=val]*]

<server> is either a hostname, an IPv4 or an IPv6 address.

Aruments supported by libsmb2 are :
 sec=<mech>    : Mechanism to use to authenticate to the server. Default
	         is any available mech, but can be overridden by :
		 krb5: Only use Kerberos
		 ntlmssp : Only use NTLMSSP


Authentication
==============
Authentication is implemented using MIT Kerberos and it supports both KRB5
for authentication against Active Directory as well as NTLMSSP for standalone
windows servers.

Using NTLMSSP authentication requies that you also install and configure
the GSS-NTLMSSP mech plugin for kerberos.
No other authentication mechanisms are planned.

To build libsmb2 you will need to have MIT Kerberos as well as its development
libraries installed.
You will also need to build and install GSS-NTLMSSP from
[https://github.com/simo5/gss-ntlmssp]

NTLM Authentication
-------------------
NTLM credentials are stored in a text file of the form :
DOMAIN:USERNAME:PASSWORD
with one line per username.
You need to set up the environment variable NTLM_USER_FILE to point to this
file.
You need one entry in this file for each local user account you want to be able
to use libsmb2 for accessing a remote share.

By default, NTLM authentication will use the username for the current process.
This can be overridden by specifying a different username in the SMB URL :
  smb://guest@server/share>?sec=ntlmssp


KRB5 Authentication
-------------------
Kerberos authentication can be used when the linux workstation as well as
the file server are part of Active Directory.

Before you can use KRB5 authentication you must first authenticate to the KDC.
Use "kinit username@YOUR-REALM" to do that in the normal way you set up
kerberos.

Once you have run kinit successfully you should be able to authenticate to the
file server using krb5 by specifying sec=krb5 in the URL :
  smb://server/share?sec=krb5
